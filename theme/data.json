Only 6% know they live in a designated flood risk area, and only 21% believe that the risk of flooding will increase over the next 25 years.\tCanadians need and want more information to be actively engaged in flood management and protected from flood risks. There is a major opportunity for transparent information sharing.\tOver 90% of homeowners think that flood maps should be made publicly available, sellers of property should be required to disclose flood risk, and property owners should be notified if their home is located in a flood risk area.","2":"Through concrete examples of good practice, this booklet offers suggestions for the improvement of communication between relevant authorities and the media, which may result in a higher quality of information disseminated to citizens. Having analysed the media coverage of the floods that affected Serbia in 2014, the booklet sought to shed light on new aspects of media reporting and to draw attention to the topics that should be the focus of media attention. At the same time, through examples seen in other countries that have been dealing with the issue of gender-sensitive reporting for several years, the publication offers recommendations and advice that could be useful in the reporting of future natural disasters and emergency situations. To that end, problems faced by journalists and the media when reporting on an emergency situation, are highlighted.","3":"This paper explores the influence of prior experiences on earthquake preparedness. Four core categories related to experience were identified, including direct disaster experience; indirect disaster experience; vicarious experience; and life experience.&nbsp;People's experiences were informed to some extent by exposure to the geographic locations they lived in and the risks they faced, but also by other events that had happened over the course of their lives.The research found that experience has the following seven different influences on the preparedness process including:\tPrompting thinking and talking;\tRaising awareness and knowledge;\tHelping individuals understand the consequences of a disaster;\tDeveloping beliefs;\tDeveloping preparedness;&nbsp;\tInfluencing emotions and feelings; and\tPrompting community interaction on disaster issues.Earthquake educators should be aware that experience does have an influence on the way people interpret hazard and preparedness issues with respect to making decisions about preparedness. Therefore, it should be considered a relevant and valuable source of information for the general public. DRR practitioners should ensure that the aforementioned aspects discussed in this paper are tailored for inclusion in future earthquake education programmes.International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction.

It is hoped that a clear set of well defined themes will help non-specialists such as journalists and newcomers make sense of this complex area of work. This document is not meant to be a glossary of DRR terminology, but serves as a broad overview of the DRR domain.It is based on the experience of the information management unit (IMU) of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) secretariat that has been collecting and classifying information of all types relating to the DRR domain over the last four years. It is a draft for comment.","17":"This book provides guidance, policy orientation and inspiration, as well as serving as a reference for lessons on how to reduce risk and vulnerability to hazards and to meet the challenges of tomorrow. It is intended for people who have an interest in and practice disaster risk management and sustainable development. Natural hazards can affect anyone, anywhere. People are threatened by hazards because of their social, economic and environmental vulnerability, which must be taken into account if sustainable development is not to be achieved. Disaster risk reduction therefore concerns everyone, from villagers to heads of states, from bankers and lawyers to farmers and foresters, from meteorologists to media chiefs. This book brings to light the urgent need for action to be taken and the people who are doing so towards building sustainable societies in an increasingly disaster-prone world.","18":"This Guide has been created to provide advice on useful strategies for implementing the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA). It represents a distillation of the wealth of experience that exists throughout the world on how to manage and reduce disaster risks. The Guide can help states to assess where they stand in the implementation process and, by building on existing experience and structure, to identify possible gaps and useful next steps to take. It does not attempt to cover all risks, nor all elements of disaster risk reduction. Some sections outline basic points and processes for disaster risk reduction, while others describe more complex tasks.Because states have the primary responsibility for disaster risk reduction, the Guide's target audience is national governments and their subsidiary local governments, including decision makers, leaders and practitioners, and other civil servants. In addition it is expected that the Guide will be of interest to a diverse audience and may be used at different levels for a variety of purposes, such as by leaders and representatives of specific sectors, civil society organizations, community organizations, the private sector, academia, international and regional organizations, and others working to reduce disaster risk reduction.The UNISDR secretariat has compiled this Guide in response to paragraph 33 (b) of the HFA, which requests that the ISDR system \"support the implementation of this Framework, identify gaps in implementation, and facilitate consultation processes to develop guidelines and policy tools for each priority area.\" The Guide has been developed through extensive consultation with key actors in disaster risk reduction, including partner agencies and experts, national platforms and regional agencies.","19":"This document presents the programme of the third session of the Global Platform on disaster risk reduction, which main theme, 'Invest today for a safer tomorrow - Increase investment in local action,' covers three main topics: (A) reconstruction and recovery; (B) economics of disaster risk reduction; and (C) alliances with climate change and development.
