This volume presents the latest ideas of the ever fascinating and challenging research of earthquake prediction. Sunspot activity and Coronal mass ejection are considered to be influential phenomena in affecting both the electric as well as the magnetic characteristics of sun-earth environment. All these changes have been observed before the occurrence of earthquakes and tsunami in various parts of the earth.","1":"'Natural hazards and disasters' emphasizes earth and atmospheric hazards that appear suddenly or rapidly, without significant warning. The text further discusses ways to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by natural hazards, providing students with the latest scientific research related to these topics. \"Case in Point\" boxes generate discussion of individual cases to natural hazard processes and principles. The authors reinforce the need to become informed citizens and make educated living decisions. Students will find a balanced coverage of North American natural hazards, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. These hazards are illustrated using numerous four-colour photos and diagrams.","2":"The adequacy of freshwater resources remains a critical challenge for a sustainable and growing society. This report presents a self-consistent risk-based assessment of water availability and use under future climate change and socioeconomic growth by midcentury across southern and eastern Asia (SEA). The authors&nbsp;employ large ensemble scenarios from an integrated modeling framework that are consistent across the spectrum of regional climate, population, and economic projections. We find socioeconomic growth contributes to an increase in water stress across the entire ensemble. However, climate change drives the ensemble central tendency toward an increase in water stress in China but a reduction in India, with a considerable spread across the ensemble.Nevertheless, the most deleterious unabated climate-change impact is a low probability but salient extreme increase in water stress over China and India. In these outcomes, annual withdrawals will routinely exceed water-storage capacity. A modest greenhouse gas mitigation pathway eliminates the likelihood of these extreme outcomes and also benefits hundreds of millions of people at risk to various levels of water stress increase. Over SEA the authors&nbsp;estimate an additional 200 million people under threat of facing at least heavily water-stressed conditions from climate change and socioeconomic growth, but the mitigation scenario reduces the additional population-under-threat by 30% (60 million). Nevertheless, there remains a 1-in-2 chance that 100 million people across SEA experience a 50% increase in water stress and a 1-in-10 chance they experience a doubling of water stress. Therefore, widespread adaptive measures may be required over the coming decades to meet these unavoidable risks in water shortfalls.&nbsp;","3":"PM2.5, or fine particulate matter, is a category of air pollutant consisting of particles with effective aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5&nbsp;&mu;m. These particles have been linked to human health impacts as well as regional haze, visibility, and climate change issues. Due to cost and space restrictions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency monitoring network remains spatially sparse. To increase the spatial resolution of monitoring, previous studies have used satellite data to estimate ground?level PM concentrations, despite these estimates being associated with moderate to large uncertainties when relating a column measure of aerosol (aerosol optical depth) with surface measurements.To this end, we discuss a low?cost air quality monitor (LCAQM) network deployed in California. In this study, we present an application of LCAQM and satellite data for quantifying the impact of wildfires in California during October 2017. The impacts of fires on PM2.5&nbsp;concentration at varying temporal (hourly, daily, and weekly) and spatial (local to regional) scales have been evaluated. Comparison between low?cost air quality sensors and reference?grade air quality instruments shows expected performance with moderate to high uncertainties. The LCAQM measurements, in the absence of federal equivalent method data, were also found to be very useful in developing statistical models to convert aerosol optical depth into PM2.5&nbsp;with performance of satellite?derived PM2.5, similar to that obtained using the federal equivalent method data. This paper also highlights challenges associated with both LCAQM and satellite?based PM2.5&nbsp;measurements, which require further investigation and research.&nbsp;&nbsp;","4":" In French: Ce guide pr\u221a\u00a9sente les principaux \u221a\u00a9l\u221a\u00a9ments de connaissance sur le risque torrentiel et les mesures de pr\u221a\u00a9vention existantes pour pr\u221a\u00a9venir ce risque.Il vise \u221a\u2020 sensibiliser les diff\u221a\u00a9rents acteurs \u221a\u2020 ce ph\u221a\u00a9nom\u221a\u00aene et \u221a\u2020 sa n\u221a\u00a9cessaire prise en compte dans l'am\u221a\u00a9nagement et l'occupation des sols, dans la conception et la construction des b\u221a\u00a2timents.A cet effet, il fournit des \u221a\u00a9l\u221a\u00a9ments de r\u221a\u00a9f\u221a\u00a9rence pour que chacun puisse rechercher des solutions pertinentes pour r\u221a\u00a9duire la vuln\u221a\u00a9rabilit\u221a\u00a9 des biens et des personnes","5":" In French:La Newsletter 2011#1: Cet article est un t\u221a\u00a9moignage du travail effectu\u221a\u00a9 par la Plate-forme d'intervention R\u221a\u00a9gionale Oc\u221a\u00a9an Indien(PIROI) sur les projets men\u221a\u00a9s en lien avec la r\u221a\u00a9duction des risques de catastrophes.

It attempts to convert findings, concepts and guidelines into a guidance document from critical gaps to bridge general drought preparedness, contingency planning and early response. The paper points out that although 'Drought Contingency Plan' and 'Drought Contingency Planning' are used interchangeably, they are not identical. With respect to this review a few conceptual and operational definitions of terms and concepts related to drought are highlighted. Whereas the contingency planning process, guidelines and evaluation have been studied at the national government and inter-agency levels, there has been little research and examination on the critical gaps in contingency plans and planning for implementing partners for effective drought preparedness and response at community levels.In an attempt to bridge the gap in the drought contingency planning process and content, the paper propose a framework and steps for combined considerations summarized in Table 5 and a contingency planning model in Figure 10. A continuum model is also proposed as a dynamic and participatory contingency planning and funding process that will work for the GHA. The paper also includes a guidance note for effective drought contingency planning, summarized in Annex 1.","11":"A glance at urban interventions by Red Cross Societies in Latin America and the Caribbean:This publication was developed in an effort to complement and inform the internal process of defining urban intervention strategies in the Americas in order to manage urban risk related to health and sanitation; food security and nutrition; road safety; social, economic and political violence; human insecurity; and disaster risk associated with the probable occurrence of diverse types of both rapid and slow onset events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fires, and drought, as well as outbreaks of disease and infection.

Particularly, this research has explored the community level practices in agriculture, housing, water resources, communication and employment generations. An empirical survey was undertaken with 145 respondents by using semi-structured interviews with selected social groups and their households? assistants. Besides face-to-face interviews, this survey applied group level qualitative assessment methods i.e. FGD (focus group discussion), Social Domain Analyses, and In-depth Interviews to collect the data. Results show that people have started to cultivate saline tolerant rice and vegetables on raised homesteads. They are using dripping irrigation methods. Rain water harvesting and artificial aquifer tube-well have been introduced for water management. The houses? mud walls have been replaced by or even newly rebuilt with Goran wood or bamboo sticks to save lives. They have formed groups to save money for the next disaster and taken out loans for small entrepreneurship projects. Due to the crises of fodder, pastureland and freshwater, people have started to rear small animals and birds like sheep, goat and pigeon instead of cow and buffalo. New technology based shrimp farming is another new innovation. Discussions were held on the pros and cons of all of the above strategies that help to design the long-term risk reduction planning at the local level and addresses the ?not the need-based planning but the acceptance-based strategies? mantra of development in context of community based disaster management planning.

These papers are discussed in terms of vital elements for integrated disaster risk science, namely: analysis, theory and links to practice. The special issue papers include a landmark case study of community-led disaster recovery, amongst indigenous M?ori affected by the earthquakes of 2011 and 2012 in Canterbury, New Zealand. Another paper takes an international approach, to analysing the use of the term ?disaster? in English speaking contexts. A paper on vulnerability and response to disasters provides a detailed account of needs for disaster risk reduction in low-income countries, such as Ghana. Vulnerabilities are also explored in a paper about the challenges faced by people with disabilities during an earthquake. The special issue concludes with a thought-provoking paper on concepts of modernity, which takes an expansive and historical view of the disaster risk domain. In sum, special issue authors have produced relatively unique combinations of disaster risk analysis, theory and links to practice. This special issue therefore represents an important illustration of integrated disaster risk research.","33":"Australasian Journal of Disaster and Trauma Studies, Volume 19, Special Issue:This paper reports on findings from the research relating to emergency preparedness and perceptions of vulnerability among disabled people who were living in Christchurch over the extended period in which the earthquakes occurred. Qualitative inquiry was carried out, involving purposive sampling and face to face interviews with 23 disabled people and four agency representatives living in Christchurch during the earthquakes. The qualitative research was followed by a pilot quantitative survey involving 25 disabled people living in Christchurch during the earthquakes and 10 people who work in the disability sector. Qualitative interview material was analysed using thematic analysis while quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. All findings are related to sections of the Hyogo Framework for Action. The research identified that prior to the September earthquake, disabled people were not prepared for an emergency. Following the earthquake most people took steps to ensure that they were better prepared. However, few disabled people were able to prepare for an emergency without support. Vulnerability was discussed by participants in relation to personal safety, communication, housing, transport and financial hardship. A lack of community preparedness alongside insufficient structures to assist disabled people in the disaster response or recovery phases increased exposure to risk. It was relevant to discuss findings with reference to the Hyogo Framework for Action?s emphasis on vulnerable communities, given that this international document was under review at the time of writing. The research suggests that disabled people are more likely to be impacted in a civil emergency and are less likely to be prepared. Emergency preparedness management needs to engage with disabled people in the community and have specific policies to assist disabled people prior to and in the event of a disaster.","34":"Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, early online release, doi: 10.1175\/BAMS-D-11-00262.1: This paper presents the state of knowledge regarding trends and an understanding of their causes  for the following weather types: (i) severe convective storms (tornadoes, hail storms, and severe thunderstorms), (ii) extreme precipitation, (iii) hurricanes and typhoons, and (iv) severe snowstorms and ice storms.

It describes how the players were thoroughly unprepared on almost every level for the cascading nuclear disaster.","36":"Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2013;91:784-789. doi: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2471\/BLT.13.117945:This report presents the outcome of a project carried out with the aim to establish an efficient system of infection surveillance to cover all of the clinics in Rikuzen-Takata of Japan in the wake of the the Great East Japan Earthquake ? using only the resources that were locally available: The project also aimed to maintain this system until most of the evacuation centres would be closed. The project found that to protect the survivors of natural disasters from diseases the prompt establishment ? or re-establishment ? of a system of infection surveillance is essential. Infection surveillance is known to have played an important role in preventing outbreaks of communicable diseases following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. After the Great East Japan Earthquake, primary medical care was rapidly provided by the development of several stand-alone clinics that were run by local and visiting teams of health personnel. The rigorous cooperation between support teams and the effective communication network ? that, together, would allow the rapid redevelopment of an effective city-wide system of health care ? took longer to develop.","37":"Cahier des changements climatiques, \u221a\u00a9dition sp\u221a\u00a9ciale, Octobre 2010 (in French): Ce num\u221a\u00a9ro vise \u221a\u2020 sensibiliser le public urbain sah\u221a\u00a9lien sur les risques li\u221a\u00a9s aux changements climatiques.

The scenario was developed to better understand tsunami impacts to California coastal communities. It includes evaluations of tsunami science such as tsunami source mechanics and tsunami deposits, as well as estimates of potential damage and the socio-economic and environmental impacts from such a scenario.The document presents evidence for past tsunamis, the scientific basis for the source, likely inundation areas, current velocities in key ports and harbors, physical damage and repair costs, economic consequences, environmental and ecological impacts, social vulnerability, emergency management and evacuation challenges, and policy implications for California associated with this hypothetical tsunami. It also discusses ongoing mitigation efforts by the State of California and new communication products. The intended users are those who need to make mitigation decisions before future tsunamis, and those who will need to make rapid decisions during tsunami events. The results of the tsunami scenario will help managers understand the context and consequences of their decisions and how they may improve preparedness and response.","39":"Cambridge Coastal Research Unit working paper 40, natural coastal protection series, report 1:This report focuses on mangrove forests and the role they can play in reducing wind and swell waves. It aims to review available information about the capacity of mangroves to reduce wind and swell waves, in order to inform decision makers, planners and coastal engineers about the role mangroves can play in coastal defense against these hazards. It comes as the first in a series of technical reports investigating the role of ecosystems in coastal defense. The report begins by reviewing the capacity of mangroves to attenuate wind and swell waves. It looks at evidence for wave attenuation in mangroves, and reviews the factors affecting the rate of attenuation with distance. It then considers models that have been used to predict wave attenuation, and looks at what information is needed in order to use these models. Finally it looks at how these models have been used to plan the use of mangroves in coastal defense strategies.","40":"Cambridge Coastal Research Unit working paper 41, natural coastal protection series, report 2:This report explores the capacity of mangroves to reduce storm surge water levels and inundation, and hence to reduce the impact of storm surges on coastal populations and infrastructure. The first section provides some basic information about storm surges and the factors affecting surge levels and surge reduction. Section 2 explores the evidence for mangroves reducing storm surge water levels, followed by Section 3, which focuses on the attributes of mangroves that affect the level of storm surge reduction. Section 4 reviews the effect of mangroves on surface wind speeds, which affect wave generation and hence surge water levels. Section 5 reviews the literature on the ability of mangroves to reduce loss and damage caused by storm surges. Section 6 then explores how mangroves are themselves affected by storm surges and cyclones. The report is intended to inform decision makers, planners and coastal engineers about the potential role that mangroves can play in coastal defence against storm surges.","41":"Cambridge coastal research unit working paper 41:This report explores the capacity of mangroves to reduce storm surge water levels and inundation, and hence to reduce the impact of storm surges on coastal populations and infrastructure, in order to inform decision makers, planners and coastal engineers about the potential role that mangroves can play in coastal defence against storm surges.The first section of the report provides some basic information about storm surges and the factors affecting surge levels and surge reduction.

The investigation looks at three elements of programming: baseline community perceptions of climate and health, integration of climate information in operations, and resulting community-level risk reduction behaviour. (1) Through community focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and household surveys, our research reveals that potential health effects of climate variability and change are a key concern at the community level. (2) Project implementors used climate information to design educational materials and health contingency plans to inform when and where disease prevention activities should be concentrated. This climate-based disease anticipation and improved sharing of incidence data aimed to quickly detect and respond to changing disease patterns in a variable climate. (3) Subsequently, community-level risk reduction behaviour significantly increased in project locations. This pilot is evidence that climate information and considerations can be readily integrated into health programming to account for changing risks, using existing disease prevention techniques to address priority concerns of vulnerable communities.","43":"Climate and society no.3:This issue highlights recent advances in the use of climate information to manage risks and improve livelihoods, such as new partnerships and user-designed information platforms. It draws together and analyses experiences from 17 case studies that capture the current state of knowledge. It also highlights research innovations in technical boxes throughout the publication. This publication focuses solely on climate-related disasters, including tropical cyclones, storms, floods, landslides, droughts, heat waves, blizzards, and some outbreaks of epidemic diseases.The report uses a problem solving framework to demonstrate the challenges and opportunities facing disaster risk managers in using climate science with a three step approach: (i) identifying the problem, (ii) developing tools, and (iii) taking action, reflected in the chapter titles. The case studies and experiences presented in this book draw on a wealth of practical experience from within the humanitarian community. This publication adds to the growing body of knowledge, focusing on the experiences of a number of mostly non-governmental actors, especially the International Federation of Red Cross, and how through partnerships, they have helped to integrate state of the art climate science and information into improved decision-making.","44":"Climate change and disaster risk reduction ? mainstreaming disability:This paper sets out key recommendations for including persons with disabilities throughout the disaster management cycle, especially during relief operations, as well as in climate change discussions or actions.
